					<h2>Roleplay</h2>
					<p>Pyreanor houses several Roleplay subgroups under our banner, some sharing the same plot while others are independent. You don't need to be a member of the guild to participate and some of the projects have their own vanity guilds bridged with Pyreanor and our sister guilds via an addon called Greenwall.</p>
					<p>We've made a deliberate decision to make our own storylines that are evergreen and independent of Blizzard's narratives so that things don't get mucked up by Blizzard's storytelling.</p>
					<p>Our groups exist within an extended opt-in version of the Azeroth universe we call Plumecraft. You can read our lorecrafting at the <a href="https://plumecraft.silvermoon.city/index.php">Plumecraft Wiki</a>.</p>

					<h4>House Pyreanor</h4>
					<p>House Pyreanor is an affluent mercantile family and boarding house located in The Bazaar of Silvermoon City. The Pyreanor boarding house shelters oddballs, misfits, and escaped experiments from The Society plotline. It's a safe haven for the vulnerable from the wicked and cruel full of eccentric individuals and mischief.</p>

					<p>Several businesses operate under the Pyreanor banner which can serve as day jobs for non-combatant characters. These include a bakery, a candy shop, a technology company, a creamery, a bank, and a general store. Contact an officer if you wish to write your character as having a job at one of these locations in your background.</p>

					<p>Outside of the escaped experiments and regular residents, Pyreanor also houses a majority of Sunrunner Brigade and Felstrike. Liadrin's Shield use the Pyreanor as their base of operations and meeting place in Silvermoon City. It's not uncommon for said parties to be present at the business.</p>

					<h4>The Society Plotline</h4>
					<p><i>The Society for the Preservation and Advancement of the Thalassian people—A charitable order of magi and scientists with a pristine reputation—and front to a malevolent nebulous organization. To preserve they engage in eugenics and keeping specimens. To advance they engage in abduction of the weak and vulnerable on whom they preform twisted experiments.</i></p>
					<p><i>Few outside of The Society know the truth and are targets of malicious attacks as punishment for their meddling. Worse, those who know can't tell anyone because no one will believe that a loved charity is secretly evil. Instead they fight a secret war to end the horrors of The Society one cell at a time.</i></p>
