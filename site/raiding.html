					<h2>Pyreanor Raiding</h2>
					<center><img src="images/siredown.png" alt="boss kill picture of Sire Denathrius."></center>
					<p>Pyreanor is a raiding guild  on Wyrmrest Accord-US with a goal of downing normal and heroic content and earning "Ahead of the Curve" achievements by the end of Shadowlands.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to create a healthy raiding environment--to kill bosses and loot epics--devoid of people who scream at others in voice chat, have raging tantrums, and quit at the first sign of struggle. Wipes are a part of learning and THAT is progression.</p>
					<p>Aside from the raiding aspirations, we help others gear up and we teach new players. We have a weekly schedule and events almost every night of the week including Torghast night, key night, and a casual BG night each week.</p>
					<p>We're a guild that welcomes diversity and has an LGBTQIA presence.</p>

					<h4>About Us</h4>
					<p>Pyreanor is a diverse guild with members ranging from 20-60, with straight and queer membership. Some of us have been playing together a long time, dating back as far back as Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King.</p>
					<p>We're experienced. Our officers have varying levels of raid experience from as far back as the original Molten Core. Some of us have raided deep into old heroic progression (now called Mythic). We've turned Pyreanor into a raiding guild after a hiatus where we realized we missed the comradere of raiding and seek to recreate the fun we once enjoyed together. </p>
					<p>We're too old to put up with bad behavior, drama, ragequitters, or other unsavory things. We expect that members will be excellent to each other regardless of age, race, color, creed, sex, sexuality, gender identity, etc.</p>
