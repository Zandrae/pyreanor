					<h2>Merger Information</h2>
					<p>A merger is when two guilds mutually decide to have one merge into another. Usually this comes after some time, work, and negotiation.</p>
					<h3>How things would go down.</h3>
					<p>First, we'd compare raid times, goals, and vision for our groups to find out if they're compatible. We talk and get to know each other some.</p>
					<p>After this, there's an invitation to Discord and our players playing together to assure both parties get along well. </p>
					<p>After some time, if both parties get along well, one group gquits and moves into the other guild.</p>
					<p>The guild leader of the other guild becomes an officer.</p>
