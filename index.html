					<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p>Pyreanor is a raiding guild  on Wyrmrest Accord-US with a goal of downing normal and heroic content and earning "Ahead of the Curve" achievements by the end of Shadowlands.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to create a healthy raiding environment--to kill bosses and loot epics--devoid of people who scream at others in voice chat, have raging tantrums, and quit at the first sign of struggle. Wipes are a part of learning and THAT is progression.</p>
					<p>We're a guild that welcomes diversity and has an LGBTQIA presence.</p>
					<p>We are a teaching guild and require no experience, simply a desire to learn and put your best foot forward. Raiding and a good raiding attitude are learned. Some of our leaders have been raiding since vanilla Molten Core and some of our members started raiding together in Burning Crusade and Wrath.</p>

					<h2>Pyreanor Roleplay</h2>
					<h3>A secret war...</h3>
					<p><i>The Society for the Preservation and Advancement of the Thalassian people—A charitable order of magi and scientists with a pristine reputation—and front to a malevolent nebulous organization. To preserve they engage in eugenics and keeping specimens. To advance they engage in abduction of the weak and vulnerable on whom they preform twisted experiments.</i></p>
					<p><i>Few outside of The Society know the truth and are targets of malicious attacks as punishment for their meddling. Worse, those who know can't tell anyone because no one will believe that a loved charity is secretly evil. Instead they fight a secret war to end the horrors of The Society one cell at a time.</i></p>
					<h3>About our Roleplay</h3>
					<p>Our roleplay is:
						<ul>
							<li>Optional</li>
							<li>Evergreen—not tied to current lore events so Blizzard can't mess things up.</li>
							<li>Play by post in Discord because it's most inclusive.</li>
							<li>Sometimes occurs in game</li>
							<li>Consists of multiple genres and flavors.</li>
							<li>Several share the above overarching plot hook.</li>
							<li>Open to everyone not just those in our guild.</li>
						</ul>
